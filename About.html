                <h2>Professional Student & Mediocre Gamer</h2>
                <p>
                    Introducing Jessica, a dedicated PsyD student currently nested in the scenic mountain 
                    landscape of Southern California. As the classic middle child among 2 other siblings, 
                    she's worked hard to build her life on the foundations of kindness and excellence,
                    which has served her well in her pursuit to help others through the science of psychology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After high school, Jessica embarked on the first of many transformative journey's by 
                    enlisting in the U.S. Navy. As an engine mechanic, she spent four exhilarating years 
                    working on F/A-18 aircraft and exploring the world. This chapter not only equipped her 
                    with some invaluable life skills, but also introduced her to her future spouse, 
                    adding a touch of romance to her story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the military came the beginning of her academic journey, which itself has been 
                    nothing short of remarkable. Armed with bachelor's and master's degrees in clinical 
                    psychology, and an additional master’s degree in forensic psychology, her passion for 
                    learning knows no bounds. Currently, she's fully immersed in a demanding PsyD program, 
                    specializing in neuropsychology with a focus on psychological assessments for individuals 
                    with Alzheimer’s, TBIs, and other cognitive challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the heart of Jessica's values lies kindness and a strong aversion to self-serving, 
                    narcissistic personality types, which have continually been a thorn in her side throughout 
                    the course of her life. She firmly believes in treating everyone with respect and compassion,
                    underscoring her commitment to mental well-being.
                <p>
                    Beyond academia, Jessica finds solace in a few, relatively simplistic hobbies. She's a 
                    devoted mobile gamer, an emerging photographer, and an avid reader of adult fantasy novels.
                    When adventures calls, however, she's ready for it. Just give her a parachute or a bungee 
                    cord and some room to jump!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though her immediate focus is successfully completing her PsyD program, Jessica remains 
                    open to whatever surprises life may bring. Her guiding mission is to make mental health 
                    accessible to all and to use her skills to give back to the veteran community, which has 
                    given her more than she could ever hope to repay.

                            dealing with silently in the background of their minds, until they speak
                            to someone who knows the right questions to ask."
