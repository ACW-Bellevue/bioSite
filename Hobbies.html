                    <h3>Reading</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jessica is <b><em>seriously</em></b> into adult fantasy fiction novels. Though school keeps her busy,
                        she still manages to find time to escape into the otherworldly adventures of her 
                        favorite authors, particularly those by Sarah J. Maas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How much reading does she do? Last year alone, she worked her way through over 150 books!

                    <h3>Mobile Gaming</h3>
                    <p>
                        To unwind from her hectic academic schedule, Jessica really enjoys mobile gaming,
                        in particular Stardew Valley which lets her farm, explore, and build relationships 
                        from the comfort of her couch.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        For Jessica, gaming is like a mini-vacation for the mind. It allows her to unplug from 
                        the demands of her studies and recharge her batteries.

                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an aspiring photographer, Jessica is currently working on creating her first 
                        Pixieset site. What started with family and friends has expanded to clientele in
                        her local community, and even to the plains of Africa for some wildlife shoots!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through her lens, Jessica finds great value in exploring the world from different 
                        perspectives.
